# vue3-express

## Tech stack I have used in this app
Frontend: VueJS 3 (JavaScript), Tailwind (CSS), ExpressJs backend (JavaScript). 

## Backend: ExpressJs 

I have create a simple RESTFul Api for each folder each model and route.


### How to run the app

* Unzip folder or clone the repository


#### Locally
``` bash

# Navigate to server folder 
$ cd server
# install using npm locally
$ npm install
# Complie all type script file into javascript and everything will be complied to lthe build folder
$ npm run build
# start the server from complied code
$ npm run start

# The default server port is set to 3000 
#visit http://localhost:3000 
```

## Frontend: Vue3 


#### Locally
``` bash

# Navigate to client folder 
$ cd client
# install using npm locally
$ npm install

# start the server from complied code
$ npm run serve

# The default server port is set to 8080 
#visit http://localhost:8080/ 
```

## What I can improve

From the optionals tank in this case I would like to add validation on form and also send email to clients
I have already for structure I have already setup for a large application with a help of Vuex so there is no worry
if the project is getting bigger. 

If I have more time I will write commend and add testing make sure if the project not break anywhere possible.
